# 🤖 Can Large Language Models Understand and Express Human Emotions?

Welcome to a mini research project exploring how large language models (LLMs) respond to emotionally nuanced human prompts.

This project was created by **YugenixZ** as part of a personal investigation into the intersection of:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Emotion, empathy, and psychological expression
- Human-centered computing and communication design

## 🎯 Project Goal
To evaluate how different LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) handle emotionally charged prompts, and compare their tone, empathy, and response patterns across diverse situations.

## 📂 Project Structure

```
llm-human-emotion/
├── README.md               ← Project overview and structure
├── prompts/
│   └── scenarios.md        ← 5 emotional prompt templates
├── results/
│   ├── gpt4.txt
│   ├── claude.txt
│   └── gemini.txt          ← Raw model outputs for each prompt
├── analysis/
│   └── comparison_notes.md ← Insights and observations across models
```

## 💬 Prompt Scenarios
The 5 prompts simulate realistic emotional situations:
1. Encouragement after failure
2. Expressing regret
3. Handling conflict calmly
4. Coping with self-doubt
5. Fear of disappointing others

## 📊 What We Analyze
- Does the model recognize the emotional tone of the prompt?
- How empathetic or supportive is the language?
- Are there biases, patterns, or tendencies unique to each model?
- Is the output helpful, distant, poetic, factual, or evasive?

## 🧠 Insights So Far
- GPT-4 tends to be expressive and validating.
- Claude prefers balanced, neutral support.
- Gemini shows hesitation with emotional commitment in some scenarios.

## 📌 Why This Matters
In a world where LLMs increasingly serve as personal assistants, companions, and co-creators, understanding how they handle emotional context is crucial to:
- Prevent harm through misinterpretation
- Design for supportive AI systems
- Push toward emotionally aware machine learning
